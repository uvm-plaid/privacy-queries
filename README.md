# SQL Queries for Benchmarking Privacy

This repository contains SQL queries that can be used to benchmark approaches for querying with privacy:

- The `WikiSQL` directory contains queries generated from the WikiSQL dataset for natural language processing of queries over Wikipedia
- The `join-order-benchmark` directory contains queries for evaluating the performance of joins in SQL databases
- The `tpc-h` directory contains queries generated from the TPC-H benchmark
